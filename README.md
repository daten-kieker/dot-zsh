Dotfiler: Zsh generic config
============================

[![changelog](http://allmychanges.com/p/dotfiler/zsh/badge/)](http://allmychanges.com/p/dotfiler/zsh/?utm_source=badge)

This repository contains my generic `zsh` dotfiles.
It's purpose to be used as a repository for [dotfiler][], and it is
my main dotfiler repository, because all others repositories with
shell configs are relying on the `~/.zshrc`, which "sources" all
shell files inside `~/.zsh/` directory.

For convinience, don't copy these files into you homedir. Instead,
go and install [dotfiler][], then clone this repository, using
`dot add <url>` command and run `dot update` to make all necessary
symlinks.
